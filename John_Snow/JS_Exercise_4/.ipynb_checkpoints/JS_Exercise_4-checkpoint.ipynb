    "Being a doctor, John Snow had seen many people suffer and die from cholera. It primarily affected their gastrointestinal system (vomiting and diarrhea), leading to extreme dehydration and eventually death for many. Therefore, he was convinced that it had something to do with what people were eating or drinking. He focused on the water supplies of the people of South London. However, it would be hard for him to convince people to change their beliefs, but he knew he could do it with the right data."
