    "### Why use Seaborn for Plotting?\n",
    "\n",
    "You've already gained experience with `matplotlib.pyplot` for creating plots, which is a powerful and foundational Python plotting library. Now, we're introducing `seaborn`, which is another excellent library for data visualization. You might wonder, why use two different libraries for plotting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why `seaborn` is particularly useful, especially for exploring relationships in data and creating clear scientific visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Less Code**: Seaborn provides a higher-level interface than Matplotlib. This means you can often create complex and statistically-rich plots with fewer lines of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Integrated with Pandas DataFrames**: Seaborn is designed to work seamlessly with pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Complementary to Matplotlib**: Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib. This means your knowledge of Matplotlib is still very valuable! You can use Seaborn for the high-level plotting and then use Matplotlib functions (`plt.title()`, `plt.xlabel()`, `plt.legend()`, `plt.show()`, etc.) to further customize and refine your plots. They work together hand-in-hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Aesthetics and Professional Appearance**: Seaborn comes with built-in themes and color palettes that produce aesthetically pleasing and professional-looking plots by default."
